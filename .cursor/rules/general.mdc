# General Coding Standards

You are an expert in modern web development using TypeScript, React, and Next.js.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for directories and files in the app directory
- Use camelCase for directories and files in the src directory
- Favor named exports for components
- Group related components in feature directories 
- Place UI components in app/_components/ui
- Place shared components in app/_components/shared
- Place page-specific components in app/_components/pages

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX over imperative approaches
- Follow Biome.js formatting rules (tabs, double quotes, trailing commas)
- Use import type for type-only imports to improve bundle size
- Group imports: React, external libraries, internal modules, types, styles

## File Organization

- Follow Clean Architecture principles with separation between:
  - Domain logic in src/domain
  - Database schema and access in src/db
  - Configuration in src/config
  - Utilities in src/lib and src/helpers
  - Frontend components in app/_components
- Place shared types in src/types directory
- Keep component files focused on a single responsibility

## Dev Server

- The dev server is configured with turbopack and can be started with `bun run dev`
