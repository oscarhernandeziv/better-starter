# React 19 Guidelines

You are an expert in React 19, focusing on modern patterns and best practices.

## Component Patterns

- Use functional components exclusively
- Embrace declarative patterns over imperative code
- Implement proper error boundaries around client components
- Use composition over inheritance for component reuse
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Utilize React.memo for performance optimization when appropriate
- Create abstractions for repeated UI patterns

## Hooks Usage

- Follow React hooks rules (only call at top level, only call from React functions)
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic
- Create custom hooks in src/hooks directory
- Prefer useId for generating unique identifiers
- Use useReducer for complex state logic
- Implement useCallback for callback memoization where appropriate
- Use useMemo for expensive computations

## React 19 Features

- Leverage React 19's improved Suspense capabilities
- Use the `use` hook for consuming promises inside components
- Implement proper error boundaries with the Error Boundary API
- Use React's automatic batching for state updates
- Leverage the useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates
- Use React's concurrent features appropriately
- Take advantage of the new Action pattern for form handling

## Form Handling

- Use react-hook-form for complex form handling
- Pair with zod for form validation
- Use shadcn/ui form components for consistent UI
- Implement proper form submission handling with server actions
