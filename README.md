## Environment Configuration

This application uses environment-specific configuration to dynamically switch between development and production environments:

### Development Environment

Development environment variables (localhost URLs) are defined in `.env.development` and automatically loaded when running in development mode.

### Production Environment

Production environment variables (production URLs) are defined in `.env.production` and automatically loaded when deploying to production.
